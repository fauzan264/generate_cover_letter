Dear HR Shopee,

I am writing to express my interest in the Backend position at Shopee. With a Bachelorâ€™s degree at Universitas Mercu Buana and experience in PHP framework-based web development, system monitoring, and creating Python scripts for data manipulation using GraphQL and REST APIs, I am eager to bring my technical skills to your team.

In my current role as Tech Support at GoTo Logistics, I have successfully ensured smooth system operations, managed goods migration, and supported order delivery processes. My ability to problem-solve and adapt quickly has consistently contributed to operational efficiency.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my skills align with your needs.

Sincerely,

Ahmad Fauzan
